# InSAR-Scoops3D-Inversion

This project presents a Python-based parameter inversion system that integrates SBAS-InSAR surface deformation data with Scoops3D slope stability modeling. The system is designed to estimate geotechnical parameters by coupling InSAR observations and 3D limit-equilibrium modeling, supporting layered geological inputs, automated mesh generation, and parallel simulation. 

Key features include:
- SBAS-InSAR deformation preprocessing and visibility analysis
- Geological unit classification and multi-layer model support
- Automated Scoops3D mesh generation and search matrix optimization
- Parameter inversion using grid search and correlation analysis
- GUI interface and result visualization
- Confusion matrixâ€“based model validation

This toolkit can assist researchers in landslide hazard assessment and improve the reliability of model-driven slope stability analysis.
